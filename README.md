COMP 2522 - Final Hackathon Project

This JavaFX application was created as a 12-hour "final exam" for our Object Oriented Programming 1 course in the BCIT CST program.

## How to Play
Our app is a small simulation of planets orbiting stars. The aim is to educate users on how gravitational pull in outer space works, while simultaneously being a fun minigame.

### Place Stars

*Stars* are the large immovable yellow circles that Planets orbit around. Click the Create Star button to spawn a Star in a random location.

### Place Planets

*Planets* are the smaller, colourful circles that fly around the screen. Place one by clicking anywhere, or click the Create Planet button to spawn a Planet in a random location.

Your goal is to place Stars and Planets in such a way that the Planets will collect the *Coins*, the small yellowish ovals scattered around the map. Have fun!
